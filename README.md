# Hackathon
Our Problem Statement is: Bridging the gender gap ,empowering the girl child
To combat gender imbalance and promote the value of the girl child, we propose a three-fold solution focusing on education, technology, and community engagement:

Educational Videos & Content – We will create multilingual digital content to raise awareness about gender equality, debunk myths, and share success stories. These will be distributed via social media, schools, and community centers to influence mindsets at the grassroots level.
AI Chatbot – “Sakhi” – A multilingual AI chatbot offering real-time support on gender issues, legal rights, mental health resources, and reporting discrimination. Accessible via WhatsApp, web, and mobile apps for maximum reach.
NGO Connection Platform – A digital hub linking users to verified NGOs supporting girl child welfare, enabling volunteering, assistance, and donations to drive collective action.
